Critical stuff (in no particular order)

- write documents in LaTeX/BibTeX
- make presentation slides
- make a poster
- search the astronomical literature via ADS
- search astronomical catalogs (eg, NED, SIMBAD) for properties of specific objects
- (use VO tools to) search for archived observations
- use online calculators (exposure time, cosmology)
- formulate database queries for astronomical catalogs (eg SDSS)
- convert between different file formats for things like documents, spreadsheets, slides
- use version control s/w (SVN, mercurial, git) for their own data/analysis
- use backup software
- use the Unix shell to run command-line programs
- compile C/Fortran programs written by others
- write scripts to automate the use of command-line programs
- explain the differences between common high-level programming languages (Python, R, MATLAB, IDL) used in science
- write code which uses good programming practices (documentation, testing, variable naming, modularization, use of libraries)
- use a high-level programming language to write good code to
    - manipulate and reformat tabular data and databases
    - make publication-quality plots (scatter, histogram, time series, contour, image)
    - perform statistical analyses
    - solve an equation
    - pipeline-process data (images, spectra, etc as appropriate)
    - use observations to constrain a model

Less-critical-but-still-a-good-idea

- use GitHub for remote collaboration
- use remote collaboration tools (Skype, Doodle, Slack, Google Docs)
- use a Linux package manager (rpm, homebrew, macports, ??)
- use ds9 or other tools to view and manipulate astronomical images
